A peace, V, is an anything, consisting of two aspects, P (property blob) and Q (quality blob), joined by an X transformation operator, which is in general the luminal conversation piece, c, that provides the necessary mediation transport to satisfy the universal piece (generalized peace process), X:c===(,), such that V(Q,P).

(tentative, exploration process)
V's complement, ~V(Q,P) represents said peace's relative motion transform, T(P,Q). Peaces are mediated by action minimization in generalized terms. Fundamental energetics are determined by L(P,Q)=T-V,  and H(Q,P)=V+T . [?...these are the Love and Hate mundamental mediator pieces]. Struggle and entropy, $, are in general defined and relatable to, the value returned by an anything entity maximizing its action integral.
